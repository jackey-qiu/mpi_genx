*range_*_run5:18000 generation size with 1000 population size range boundary set to [-0.5,0.5]
*range_*_run4:6000 generation size with 3000 population size range boundary set to [-0.2,0.2]
*range_*_run3: 18000 generation size with 1000 population size range boundary set to [-0.2,0.2]
*range_*_run2: 6000 generation size with 1000 population size range boundary set to [-0.2,0.2]
*range_*_run1: 6000 generation size with 1000 population size range boundary set to [-0.5,0.5]

*range1*: 6000 gen size with 1000 pop size test range boundary very close to the best fit solution
